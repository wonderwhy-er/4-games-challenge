# 4 Games Challenge 🎮

**Live Demo:** https://wonderwhy-er.github.io/4-games-challenge/

Four classic games built from a single chat session using [Desktop Commander](https://desktopcommander.app) to prove a point about AI-augmented productivity.

## The Backstory

It started with a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7415705445396615168?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7415705445396615168%2C7415756885745631232%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287415756885745631232%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7415705445396615168%29) about how AI tools are changing the way we work — not replacing jobs, but making it so frictionless to work that we end up working *more*.

> "I'm building from my iPad while 'watching TV.' Since I'm so much more productive, I'm just like, all right, I'm going to get it done... and the next thing I know, 16 hours later."

Someone replied with skepticism:

> "When you walk you can build 4 games and deploy to the stores. AI hype 🤡"

Fair point! Building 4 AAA games while walking is impossible. But small games? **Challenge accepted.**

## The Games

| Game | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🐍 **Snake** | The classic Nokia game. Eat food, grow longer, don't hit yourself or the walls. |
| 🏓 **Pong** | The grandfather of video games. VS AI or 2-player mode. |
| 🧱 **Breakout** | Smash bricks with a bouncing ball. Multiple levels with increasing difficulty. |
| 🔢 **2048** | Slide and merge tiles to reach 2048. Addictive puzzle gameplay. |

## Features

- **Retro neon cyberpunk aesthetic** — consistent design across all games
- **Mobile-friendly** — touch controls and swipe support
- **High score persistence** — localStorage saves your best scores
- **No dependencies** — pure vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## The Point

This isn't about "AI can build games." It's about the [Jevons Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) applied to work:

> Just like improved coal efficiency led to MORE coal consumption, not less — AI efficiency seems to lead to MORE work, not less.

These tools make it so frictionless to start working that we end up working from everywhere: walking the dog, riding public transport, "watching" TV.

Instead of making a note, you make a task for an agent now.
