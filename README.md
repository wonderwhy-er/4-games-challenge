## 🎯 The Challenge

It started with a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7415705445396615168?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7415705445396615168%2C7415756885745631232%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287415756885745631232%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7415705445396615168%29) about the Jevons Paradox of productivity — AI tools making us work *more*, not less.

Someone replied:

> *"When you walk you can build 4 games and deploy to the stores. AI hype 🤡🤖"*

**Chaaaallenge... acceeeepted.** 🍻

**Full chat transcript:** [View on Claude →](https://claude.ai/share/b7d99e62-7d47-488a-ab1c-e624da32aca2)

Watch how it was built in real-time. One prompt, four games, GitHub Pages deployment — all while flipping pancakes.

## 💡 The Point

This isn't about "AI can build games." It's about the **[Jevons Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)** applied to knowledge work:

> Just like improved coal efficiency led to MORE coal consumption — AI efficiency leads to MORE work, not less.

The friction to start working has dropped to near-zero. That's the actual point.

**Now replace "4 games" with:**
- Bug fix drafts
- Support ticket responses  
- Research summaries
- Content outlines

That's where the real value is.
